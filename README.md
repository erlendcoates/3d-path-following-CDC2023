## üîç Overview

The code implements a 3D path-following guidance law tailored for fixed-wing UAVs flying along arbitrary spatial curves. The control scheme is designed using a cascaded structure with:

- **Outer loop**: Generates a desired inertial velocity direction to reduce cross-track error.
- **Inner loop**: Tracks the desired air-relative velocity direction using normal acceleration control.
- **Wind compensation**: Wind triangle resolution ensures robustness in windy conditions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### Requirements

- MATLAB R2016b or newer
- No additional toolboxes required

### Run the Simulation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/erlendcoates/3d-path-following-CDC2023.git
   cd 3d-path-following-CDC2023
   ```

2. Open `run3DGuidanceSim.m` in MATLAB.

3. Run the script:
   ```matlab
   run3DGuidanceSim
   ```

4. EPS figures will be saved in the `figures/` folder.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Errata

In Fig.2 in the paper (the wind triangle), the direction of the wind velocity vector $$v_w$$ should be reversed.
